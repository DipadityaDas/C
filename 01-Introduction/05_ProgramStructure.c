// Referring to the First Program
// The First line is basically a Preprocessor Directive
// which tells the complier to include information about the 
// standard input/output library. This line appears at the 
// beginning of many C sources files.

// After that we have defined a function named main
// that receives no argument values which means there are no 
// values in between parentheses.

// The statements of main are enclosed in braces,
// which is also called function block.

// A function is called by naming it, followed by a parenthesized 
// list of arguements.

// main calls library function printf to print the argument 
// "Hello, World\n" which is a sequence of characters.

// The Sequence \n in the String is C notation for the newline 
// character, which when printed advances the output to the left 
// margins on the next line. If we leave out the \n, we will find
// that there is no line advance after the output is printed.
// We must use \n to print newline in printf.

// \n represents a single character.
// An Escape Sequence like \n provides a general and extensible
// mechanism for representing hart-to-type or invisible characters.
// Among the others that C provides are \t for tab, \b for backspace,
// \" for Double Quotes and \\ for backslash itself.
