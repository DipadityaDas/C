# C Programming Language

C is a programming language designed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs 1972.

C is very widely used, straightforward, and can be compiled to a number of platforms and operating systems.

C is a general-purpose imperative programming language, with a small number of keywords and a large number of mathematical operators. C is also a high level programming language, which means it can communicate directly with hardware(Bare metal System).




C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.

The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).

The UNIX OS was totally written in C.

C18 (previously known as C17) is the informal name for [ISO/IEC 9899:2018](https://www.iso.org/standard/74528.html), the most recent standard for the C programming language, published in June 2018. It replaced C11 (standard [ISO/IEC 9899:2011](https://www.iso.org/standard/57853.html)).

C18 will be superseded by C2x.
