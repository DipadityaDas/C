# C Programming Language

C is a programming language designed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs 1972. 

C is very widely used, straightforward, and can be compiled to a number of platforms and operating systems. C is an imperative language, with a small number of keywords and a large number of mathematical operators. C is also a very low level programming language, which means it can communicate directly with hardware.

C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.

The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).

The UNIX OS was totally written in C.
