 * Functions in C Programming Language
 * A function is a collection of statements grouped together to do some specific task.
 * 
 * Why use functions ?
 * A program is a collection of small tasks that may depend on other tasks. 
 * You can use two approaches to write a program.
 * 1. Write code for all tasks in single place, in the main() function sequentially.  
 * 2. Divide code for all tasks into separate functions. Use main() function as driver block to execute all other tasks.
 * 
 * NOTE: Without main() function C program will not execute.
